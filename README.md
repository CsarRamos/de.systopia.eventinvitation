# CiviCRM Event Invitations

## Scope
This extension allows you to invite contacts in CiviCRM to an event and provides a simple feedback form where contacts can choose whether they can attend or not. You can invite contacts via email or letter, both can include a personalized link, if you use a letter, the link can be presented as a QR link.

Currently the extension requires that you have or set up an external system that provides the rewuired feedback form. In case you would like to build your feedback form based on Drupal 8 you will most likely want to have a look at and/or use the CiviRemote Drupal module which includes a lot of pre-built features (https://github.com/systopia/civiremote).
